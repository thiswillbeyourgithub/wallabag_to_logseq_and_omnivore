# wallabag_to_logseq_and_omnivore

* simple script to make my transition from wallabag to logseq and omnivore.
    * the read articles and their highlights are imported to a md file compatible with logseq
    * the unread article's urls are exported as a csv then imported to omnivore with label "wallabag_import"
* I did this in a hurry but don't hesitate to reach out if you have any question.
